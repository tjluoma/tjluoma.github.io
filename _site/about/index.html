  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  <p>So this is the “About” page for “Rhymes With Diploma” – a website that I have started (and re-started) a number of times over the years. The name comes from the clue that I give to people who wonder how to say “Luoma”: “Lu-OH-ma… it rhymes with ‘diploma’.”</p>

<p>You can also get here by going to <a href="http://luo.ma">http://luo.ma</a> because short domains are fun.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>If you want to get in touch, you can do so via Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/tjluoma">@tjluoma</a>, or if you prefer email, try <strong>luomat</strong> at <strong>gmail</strong> dot com.</p>

<h2 id="history-and-background">History and Background</h2>

<p>I went to college to be a Computer Science major. They had these weird computers that no one had ever heard of from a company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a>. That was where I learned how to use computers.</p>

<p>Along the way I realized that I <em>hated</em> programming, but I liked <em>using</em> computers, and I really liked tinkering with them and finding ways to do things that most people didn’t know how to do. I worked at the help-desk at my college, and that’s where I learned most of the skills that I still use today.</p>

<p>I dropped my C.S. major and became an English &amp; Religious Studies double major. Upon changing my major, I famously said “I don’t know what I’m going to do with this degree, because I <em>know</em> that I don’t want to go to seminary.”</p>

<p>(Narrator’s Voiceover: “He ended up going to seminary.”)</p>

<p>Yup. You totally saw that one coming, didn’t you? I graduated from <a href="http://ptsem.edu">Princeton Theological Seminary</a> with an M.Div. – which stands for “Master of Divinity” which is, I believe, the most arrogant title in all of academia.</p>

<p>I was ordained as a Minister of Word &amp; Sacrament (aka “Teaching Elder”) in the <a href="http://pcusa.org">Presbyterian Church (USA)</a> in 1998, and have served congregations in Florida, Ohio, and New York since then.</p>

<p>I have kept my interest in computer “stuff”. Back in seminary, I worked for the “PEAK” FTP site, which was one the main places to get software for NeXTStep/OpenStep. Later I was a writer at TUAW.com (now rolled into Engadget). I have also written for <a href="https://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a> although neither frequently nor recently.</p>

<p>One of my crowning nerd-achievements is that I’ve been on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/">Mac Power Users</a> twice: episodes <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/181">181</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/321">321</a>.</p>

<p>I worked for awhile with <a href="https://1password.com">Agile Bits, makers of 1Password</a> and still wish that more people would use a password manager. And by “people” I include most of the rest of my family.</p>

<p>In 2013 I earned my “D.Min” from <a href="http://pts.edu">Pittsburgh Theological Seminary</a> in the area of “Reformed Christian Spirituality”.</p>

<p>Speaking of family, I am happily married to Tracey since 1995, and father to Ethan since 2002. Since 1997 we‘ve had at least 1 and as many as 4 dogs, most of them beagles. There are currently 3: Mort (a beagle/Jack-Russell mix who is very loud), Noah (a golden retriever who isn‘t very bright), and Shasta (a husky, who is very weird, just in general).</p>

<p>I think that says about everything that I suspect people might care about, or at least pretend to.</p>

<p>Oh, and I still like to play Words With Friends. Hit me up if you do too (I’m “tjluoma” there).</p>
