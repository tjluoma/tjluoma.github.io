  <p>It seemed simple enough, at first.</p>

<p>I was looking at something on Amazon via the Amazon app, and I wanted to view it in Safari, instead of the app.</p>

<p>Seems simple to you, too, right?</p>

<p>Well, it wasn’t. First off, there was no Share item for “Open in Safari” which seemed odd. There was one for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icab-mobile-web-browser/id308111628?mt=8">iCab</a> but not Safari.</p>

<p>“Ok,” I thought, “I’ll just make a quick shortcut that will take the URL from the Amazon app and open in Safari.”</p>

<p>That’s when things got weird.</p>

<h3 id="where-would-you-like-to-go-where-would-you-like-to-go">Where would you like to go? Where would you like to go?</h3>

<p>I figured if I was going to make a shortcut to open the URL in Safari, I might as well make it offer to open in iCab and Chrome, too.</p>

<p>The first thing that I noticed was that the page opened twice in Safari.</p>

<p>It didn’t open at all in iCab.</p>

<p>It didn’t open at all in Chrome.</p>

<p>I added an “Alert” to show me exactly what was being sent to the browsers, and it was the URL from Amazon… twice.</p>

<p>Why twice? I have no idea. If I used the Share link in the Amazon app to send to <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>, I only got the URL once. But the shortcut was getting it twice.</p>

<p>“Fine,” I thought, “I’ll just delete the second URL from the input.”</p>

<p>Except I couldn’t figure out how to do that. So instead I settled on running a loop (“Repeat with Each” in Shortcuts), and putting an “Exit Shortcut” at the bottom of the block, so it will only process the URL once.</p>

<h3 id="genius-i-thought-for-about-12-seconds">“Genius!” I thought. For about 12 seconds.</h3>

<p>After I managed to get the URL to only be sent once… it still didn’t work. I was sending the URL to iCab via x-callback-url, but it was launching, but the URL wasn’t opened (I’m completely willing to admit that might have been my fault for something I was doing wrong, but it seemed to work sometimes, and then stopped).</p>

<p>Safari no longer opened the URL twice… but instead it immediately redirected me back to the Amazon app.</p>

<p>Chrome worked fine.</p>

<p><strong>ARGH.</strong></p>

<p>I searched around for a way to stop Safari from doing that, but the only suggestion was to uninstall the Amazon app.</p>

<p>Not helpful.</p>

<p>Finally, I decided to implement a decidedly-stupid workaround which works: I created a small PHP page which will accept a URL as a query string, and then redirect the browser to that URL. If I send <em>that</em> to Safari, it will open the page as expected.</p>

<h3 id="icab-and-1password">iCab and 1Password</h3>

<p>Something made me remember that I used to be able to send links from Safari to iCab by using a bookmarklet which changed “http:“ to “web:“ and “https:“ to “webs:“. I changed my shortcut (using “Replace Text”) to change those protocols before opening the URLs, and suddenly I could open the page in iCab too.</p>

<p><em>That</em> made me remember that 1Password also had a way to open URLs in its built-in browser., but I couldn’t remember what it was, and “onepassword:” didn’t seem to work. However, a little Googling led me to a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/links/1password-4-1/">MacStories post from 5½ years ago</a> which reminded me that the protocols I needed were “ophttp:” and “ophttps”.  I had a vague memory that 1Password had deprecated support for opening URLs this way, but it still works.</p>

<h3 id="the-end-result">The End Result</h3>

<p>Finally, I have a shortcut that can take a URL (from Amazon’s app or anywhere else) and offers to open it in Safari, iCab, Chrome, or 1Password.</p>

<p>You’re welcome to use it too, if you like. You can find it here: <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b1a04d9865ac431799668c15d785b66e">Open In Browser (v.1.0)</a>.</p>

<p>If I make changes/improvements to it, I’ll post those here and update the link.</p>
