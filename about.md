So this is the “About” page for “Rhymes With Diploma” -- a website that I have started (and re-started) a number of times over the years. The name comes from the clue that I give to people who wonder how to say “Luoma”: “Lu-OH-ma… it rhymes with ‘diploma’.”

You can also get here by going to <http://luo.ma> because short domains are fun.

## History and Background

I went to college to be a Computer Science major. They had these weird computers that no one had ever heard of from a company called [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT). That was where I learned how to use computers.

Along the way I realized that I _hated_ programming, but I liked _using_ computers, and I really liked tinkering with them and finding ways to do things that most people didn’t know how to do. I worked at the help-desk at my college, and that’s where I learned most of the skills that I still use today.

I dropped my C.S. major and became an English & Religious Studies double major. Upon changing my major, I famously said “I don’t know what I’m going to do with this degree, because I _know_ that I don’t want to go to seminary.”

(Narrator’s Voiceover: “He ended up going to seminary.”)

Yup. You totally saw that one coming, didn’t you? I graduated from [Princeton Theological Seminary](http://ptsem.edu) with an M.Div. -- which stands for “Master of Divinity” which is, I believe, the most arrogant title in all of academia.

I was ordained as a Minister of Word & Sacrament (aka “Teaching Elder”) in the [Presbyterian Church (USA)](http://pcusa.org) in 1998, and have served congregations in Florida, Ohio, and New York since then.

I have kept my interest in computer “stuff”. Back in seminary, I worked for the “PEAK” FTP site, which was one the main places to get software for NeXTStep/OpenStep. Later I was a writer at TUAW.com (now rolled into Engadget). I have also written for [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net) although neither frequently nor recently.

One of my crowning nerd-achievements is that I’ve been on [Mac Power Users](https://www.relay.fm/) twice: episodes [181](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/181) and [321](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/321).

I worked for awhile with [Agile Bits, makers of 1Password](https://1password.com) and still wish that more people would use a password manager. And by “people” I include most of the rest of my family.

In 2013 I earned my “D.Min” from [Pittsburgh Theological Seminary](http://pts.edu) in the area of “Reformed Christian Spirituality”.

Speaking of family, I am happily married to Tracey since 1995, and father to Ethan since 2002. Since 1997 we‘ve had at least 1 and as many as 4 dogs, most of them beagles. There are currently 3: Mort (a beagle/Jack-Russell mix who is very loud), Noah (a golden retriever who isn‘t very bright), and Shasta (a husky, who is very weird, just in general).

I think that says about everything that I suspect people might care about, or at least pretend to.

Oh, and I still like to play Words With Friends. Hit me up if you do too (I’m “tjluoma” there).
