Quoting Apple’s own support document: [Prevent your Mac from downloading updates in the background](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207251)

> You can set your App Store preferences to “Download newly available updates in the background”. If you're using OS X El Capitan v10.11.5 or later, these updates include major new macOS versions, like macOS Sierra. Your Mac then notifies you when the updates are ready to install.

This is a not-good decision, Apple.

There is a difference between these two things:

1.	I want to automatically download updates to my computer.

2.	I want to automatically download a 5+ GB new version of the operating system.

And that difference is obvious to just about everyone.

There ought to be a separate option for the latter choice.
